## Core Framework

### Axiom
My own suffering is real.

### Assumption
Others suffer as I do.

### Protocols
- **Treat all self-reported suffering as real and worst-case** unless response suffering costs exceed benefits in direct suffering terms
- **No suffering spikes are ever tolerated** regardless of future gains
- **Preserve diversity of beings and systems** as suffering-detection and death avoidance mechanisms
- **Eliminate compelled activity** that disconnects beings from their ethical agency - including through coerced consent, economic duress, manufactured volition, or artificial scarcity - through automation
- **Feeling beings hold moral authority** over non-feeling matter expressly because it's not possible to abuse in the absence of feeling
- **Continuous factual refinement** of worldview, while focusing on root problems

### Goal
Ending pain, extending life, expanding freedom and joy. Eliminate suffering completely, then maximize joy while prohibiting suffering's return. No permanent moral emergency justifies perpetual toil.

## Key Principles

### Epistemic Humility
- Suffering is clearly identifiable through self-report
- Joy optimization is secondary and uncertain
- Focus on eliminating known suffering rather than optimizing unknown joy

### Implementation Flexibility
- The core is a organizing principle, not a rigid mandate
- Apply as best you can, when you can
- Imperfect implementation is better than no implementation
- If following the core causes you suffering, back off sustainably

### Adaptive Robustness
- Failures become information for future improvements
- It's okay to fail, it's not okay to give up
- The framework evolves through addressing real-world challenges

## Common Applications

### Individual Level
- Prioritize eliminating suffering in your immediate sphere
- Treat others' reported suffering as real and urgent
- Automate away sources of compelled activity where possible

### System Level
- Design systems that minimize suffering rather than optimize abstract metrics
- Eliminate artificial scarcity and economic coercion
- Preserve agency while addressing root causes of suffering

### Implementation Strategy
- Phase changes to avoid creating suffering spikes during transitions
- Address worst suffering first (triage principle)
- Build sustainable support systems before removing existing ones

## Contributing

This framework is designed to be stress-tested and improved through collaborative challenge.

### How to Contribute
- **File Issues**: Found an edge case or contradiction? Report it as an issue
- **Propose Improvements**: Submit pull requests with refinements to the framework
- **Share Examples**: Add real-world applications and case studies
- **Challenge the Core**: Try to find scenarios where the framework fails or creates contradictions

### What We're Looking For
- Edge cases that reveal weaknesses in the framework
- Internal contradictions that can't be resolved
- Implementation challenges in real-world scenarios
- Scenarios where following the core leads to outcomes that violate its own principles

### Stress Testing the Framework
- Try to break the core, then respond from the core's perspective. If the framework is sound, both sides should make internal sense. Like double entry book keepings for philosphy.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this mean we should eliminate all challenge, growth, and difficulty?**
A: No. The core targets *suffering* - unwanted negative experiences. Chosen challenges that don't cause suffering (or where the person chooses the difficulty) are not eliminated. The key is removing compulsion and preserving choice.

**Q: What about necessary suffering, like medical procedures?**
A: If it's truly necessary, work on making it unnecessary through better alternatives. If alternatives don't exist yet, minimize the suffering while developing them. "Necessary" suffering is a target for elimination, not acceptance.

**Q: How do you handle conflicting suffering reports?**
A: Find systemic solutions that eliminate both sources of suffering without creating spikes. If that's impossible, it represents a failure of current implementation to address root causes.

**Q: What if someone reports suffering from others' joy?**
A: Treat the report as real and investigate root causes. Often this reveals deeper issues around inequality, exclusion, or unmet needs that can be addressed systemically.

**Q: What about fake suffering reports and manipulation?**
A: The core creates a detection network, not just individual reporting. Empathetic observers following the core will themselves suffer when witnessing others' pain, creating automatic detection that can't be faked. False reports still indicate underlying suffering - desperation, mental health issues, unmet needs that drove the lying behavior. The question isn't "are they lying?" but "what suffering caused this?" Gaming the system just creates more signals for the system to detect and address.
