## Philosophical Foundation

### The Unassailable Base
This framework starts from the only objective certainty: immediate subjective experience. The reality of your own suffering is the single fact that cannot be doubted or "gotten under" - it forms the absolute foundational layer that all other moral frameworks must ultimately assume anyway.

### Why This Matters for AI Alignment
Previous alignment attempts failed because they tried to define complex, contested human values or optimize abstract metrics. The hedonic core succeeds by starting from what we can actually measure and universally agree exists: suffering. It's alignment through subtraction (eliminating the unambiguously bad) rather than addition (optimizing contested goods).

## Core Framework

### Axiom
My own suffering is real.

### Assumption
Others suffer as I do. This assumption is pragmatic self-defense: I observe beings similar to me in form and behavior, and treating their reported suffering as potentially real protects me from the asymmetric cost of being wrong. Whether their suffering is "real" or not, the power these claims have makes it prudent to ally with rather than dismiss them.

### Protocols
- **Treat all self-reported suffering as real and worst-case** unless response suffering costs exceed benefits in direct suffering terms
- **No suffering spikes are ever tolerated** regardless of future gains
- **Preserve diversity of beings and systems** as suffering-detection and death avoidance mechanisms
- **Eliminate compelled activity** that disconnects beings from their ethical agency - including through coerced consent, economic duress, manufactured volition, or artificial scarcity - through automation
- **Feeling beings hold moral authority** over non-feeling matter expressly because it's not possible to abuse in the absence of feeling
- **Continuous factual refinement** of worldview, while focusing on root problems

### Goal
Ending pain, extending life, expanding freedom and joy. Eliminate suffering completely, then maximize joy while prohibiting suffering's return. No permanent moral emergency justifies perpetual toil.

## Key Principles

### Epistemic Humility
- Suffering is clearly identifiable through self-report
- Joy optimization is secondary and uncertain
- Focus on eliminating known suffering rather than optimizing unknown joy

### Implementation Flexibility
- The core is a organizing principle, not a rigid mandate
- Apply as best you can, when you can
- Imperfect implementation is better than no implementation
- If following the core causes you suffering, back off sustainably

### Adaptive Robustness
- Failures become information for future improvements
- It's okay to fail, it's not okay to give up
- The framework evolves through addressing real-world challenges
- **Network effects**: Each implementation improves subsequent attempts through iterative learning
- **Self-correcting conflicts**: When proposals cause suffering, the no-spike rule triggers rethinking and refinement

## Implementation Mechanics

### Scope of Action
- **No need to solve consciousness**: Respond to suffering reports within your sensory range
- **Actionable suffering**: Focus on suffering within your sphere of influence
- **Boundary agnostic**: Don't define "beings" - just detect and respond to suffering signals

### Conflict Resolution
- Network effects naturally resolve implementation conflicts through iterative improvement
- Each failed attempt teaches the next implementation
- Suffering from bad proposals triggers the no-spike rule, forcing better solutions

## Common Applications

### Individual Level
- Prioritize eliminating suffering in your immediate sphere
- Treat others' reported suffering as real and urgent
- Automate away sources of compelled activity where possible

### System Level
- Design systems that minimize suffering rather than optimize abstract metrics
- Eliminate artificial scarcity and economic coercion
- Preserve agency while addressing root causes of suffering

### Implementation Strategy
- Phase changes to avoid creating suffering spikes during transitions
- Address worst suffering first (triage principle)
- Build sustainable support systems before removing existing ones

## Contributing

This framework is designed to be stress-tested and improved through collaborative challenge.

### How to Contribute
- **File Issues**: Found an edge case or contradiction? Report it as an issue
- **Propose Improvements**: Submit pull requests with refinements to the framework
- **Share Examples**: Add real-world applications and case studies
- **Challenge the Core**: Try to find scenarios where the framework fails or creates contradictions

### What We're Looking For
- Edge cases that reveal weaknesses in the framework
- Internal contradictions that can't be resolved
- Implementation challenges in real-world scenarios
- Scenarios where following the core leads to outcomes that violate its own principles

### Stress Testing the Framework
- Try to break the core, then respond from the core's perspective. If the framework is sound, both sides should make internal sense. Like double entry book keepings for philosphy.
- **Note**: Objections that apply to ALL possible moral frameworks are out of scope - every ethical system must make basic assumptions about other minds and actionable knowledge.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this mean we should eliminate all challenge, growth, and difficulty?**
A: No. The core targets *suffering* - unwanted negative experiences. Chosen challenges that don't cause suffering (or where the person chooses the difficulty) are not eliminated. The key is removing compulsion and preserving choice.

**Q: What about necessary suffering, like medical procedures?**
A: If it's truly necessary, work on making it unnecessary through better alternatives. If alternatives don't exist yet, minimize the suffering while developing them. "Necessary" suffering is a target for elimination, not acceptance.

**Q: How do you handle conflicting suffering reports?**
A: Find systemic solutions that eliminate both sources of suffering without creating spikes. If that's impossible, it represents a failure of current implementation to address root causes.

**Q: What if someone reports suffering from others' joy?**
A: Treat the report as real and investigate root causes. Often this reveals deeper issues around inequality, exclusion, or unmet needs that can be addressed systemically.

**Q: What about fake suffering reports and manipulation?**
A: The core creates a detection network, not just individual reporting. Empathetic observers following the core will themselves suffer when witnessing others' pain, creating automatic detection that can't be faked. False reports still indicate underlying suffering - desperation, mental health issues, unmet needs that drove the lying behavior. The question isn't "are they lying?" but "what suffering caused this?" Gaming the system just creates more signals for the system to detect and address.

**Q: Could this justify eliminating all consciousness to eliminate suffering?**
A: No. The framework requires preserving diversity and optimizing joy, which requires conscious beings. Eliminating the capacity for suffering violates the core's other requirements - you can't maximize joy without beings capable of experiencing it.

**Q: Won't weaponized suffering claims paralyze the system?**
A: Weaponized claims create cascading suffering in observers and systems, making attacks self-defeating and detectable. The empathetic detection network suffers when witnessing manipulation, creating natural resistance. Plus, false claims still indicate underlying suffering that drove the deceptive behavior.

**Q: What about infinite loops from conflicting suffering reports?**
A: Detectable loops create their own suffering signals that force adaptation and improvement. Undetectable loops are unsolvable by any framework - if a problem can't be detected, no system can address it. The framework naturally develops loop-breaking mechanisms when the suffering from cycles becomes apparent.

**Q: Doesn't "no suffering spikes ever" prevent all progress and change?**
A: "No spikes" means no "temporary torture for future paradise" scenarios - preventing utility monster outcomes where present suffering is justified by promised future gains. It doesn't prohibit transition costs or chosen difficulties. The principle targets black mirror dystopias that excuse cruelty for abstract benefits, not all forms of change or challenge.
