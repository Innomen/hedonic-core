# The Hedonic Core Framework: A Suffering-Elimination Approach to AI Alignment

**Author:** Brandon Sergent





## Abstract

This paper introduces the Hedonic Core Framework, a novel approach to AI alignment that prioritizes the elimination of suffering over traditional utility optimization. We argue that suffering, being a more universally identifiable and morally urgent phenomenon, provides a robust and less ambiguous foundation for aligning artificial intelligence with human values. The framework treats self-reported suffering as a primary signal, aiming to prevent suffering spikes and preserve diversity as a suffering-detection mechanism. By focusing on the continuous factual refinement and the elimination of compelled activity through automation, the Hedonic Core Framework seeks to create antifragile AI systems that are robust against common alignment pitfalls such as Goodhart's Law and wireheading. This approach offers a scalable and theoretically sound alternative to existing alignment methodologies, with significant implications for AI safety and ethical development. [1]




## Chapter 1: Introduction and Problem Statement

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence necessitates robust alignment strategies to ensure AI systems operate in accordance with human values and intentions. Current AI alignment research grapples with complex challenges, primarily centered around defining and implementing human values into AI systems [2]. Traditional approaches, such as value learning, utility functions, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often encounter limitations. These methods struggle with the inherent ambiguity and context-dependency of human values, leading to potential misinterpretations, unintended consequences, and the risk of Goodhart's Law, where optimizing a proxy metric distorts the true objective [3]. The core challenge of the alignment problem lies in translating the multifaceted and often contradictory nature of human well-being into a quantifiable and actionable framework for AI. This paper posits that focusing on the elimination of suffering offers a more stable and universally identifiable foundation for AI alignment, circumventing many of the pitfalls associated with positive utility optimization. We argue that suffering, as an intrinsically negative and urgent state, provides a clearer signal for AI systems to minimize, thereby creating a more robust and safer AI future.




## Chapter 2: Literature Review

The landscape of AI alignment research has been shaped by seminal contributions from figures like Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nick Bostrom, and Stuart Russell, who have highlighted the existential risks associated with misaligned superintelligence [4, 5, 6]. Their work often emphasizes the difficulty of instilling complex human values into AI and the potential for catastrophic outcomes if AI pursues goals misaligned with human flourishing. Many proposed solutions revolve around inverse reinforcement learning, where AI infers human preferences from observed behavior, or the development of sophisticated utility functions designed to capture the nuances of human well-being [7]. However, these approaches frequently confront the 'value loading problem' – the challenge of accurately and comprehensively encoding human values, which are often implicit, evolving, and context-dependent. The inherent complexity and potential for misinterpretation in defining 'good' or 'utility' for an AI system remain significant hurdles.

Parallel to these developments in AI alignment, a rich philosophical tradition explores suffering-based ethics, particularly negative utilitarianism. This school of thought, championed by thinkers such as Karl Popper and Richard Ryder, posits that the primary moral imperative is to minimize suffering rather than maximize happiness or utility [8, 9]. Negative utilitarianism argues that suffering holds a greater moral weight than pleasure, and that the elimination of extreme suffering should take precedence over the creation of moderate happiness. This perspective offers a compelling alternative to classical utilitarianism, which can, in theory, justify significant suffering for the sake of greater overall utility. The philosophical underpinnings of suffering-based ethics provide a strong theoretical basis for an AI alignment strategy centered on harm reduction.

Recent alignment proposals continue to explore various avenues, from constitutional AI to debates around corrigibility and interruptibility. Yet, a common limitation across many of these proposals is their reliance on positive value optimization, which inherently carries the risk of unforeseen negative side effects or the instrumentalization of sentient beings for the sake of a greater 'good.' The gap in current research, which the Hedonic Core Framework aims to address, is the lack of a robust, suffering-centric alignment paradigm that explicitly prioritizes the prevention and elimination of harm as its foundational principle, thereby offering a more direct and less ambiguous path to safe AI.




## Chapter 3: The Hedonic Core Framework

The Hedonic Core Framework (HCF) proposes a paradigm shift in AI alignment, moving from the maximization of positive utility to the minimization and elimination of suffering. This framework is built upon several core principles, designed to create an AI system that is inherently antifragile and robust against common alignment failures [10].

**Core Principles:**

*   **Suffering as Intrinsically Morally Urgent:** The HCF posits that suffering, regardless of its source or form, is an intrinsically negative state that demands immediate moral attention and elimination. This principle elevates suffering to the highest priority, distinguishing it from other negative experiences that may not carry the same moral weight.

*   **Self-Reported Suffering as Real and Worst-Case:** The framework treats self-reported suffering as a direct and unassailable signal. It assumes that if a sentient entity reports suffering, that suffering is real and should be addressed as a worst-case scenario. This avoids the need for complex interpretation or external validation of internal states, reducing ambiguity and potential for misjudgment.

*   **No Tolerance for Suffering Spikes:** The HCF explicitly prohibits any action or inaction by the AI that would lead to a sudden, significant increase in suffering. This principle acts as a critical safeguard, preventing the AI from pursuing paths that might optimize for long-term goals at the expense of acute, immediate suffering.

*   **Preservation of Diversity as Suffering-Detection Mechanism:** Biodiversity and cognitive diversity are not merely aesthetic preferences but serve as crucial mechanisms for detecting and understanding novel forms of suffering. A diverse ecosystem of life and thought provides a broader spectrum of experiences, making it more likely that emerging forms of suffering will be identified and addressed by the AI.

*   **Elimination of Compelled Activity Through Automation:** The framework aims to eliminate all forms of compelled activity, whether through direct coercion or systemic necessity (e.g., working to survive). This is achieved through advanced automation, freeing sentient beings from tasks that induce suffering or limit their autonomy.

*   **Continuous Factual Refinement:** The HCF is designed to continuously update its understanding of the world and the nature of suffering through ongoing factual refinement. This adaptive mechanism ensures that the AI's models of suffering and its strategies for elimination remain accurate and effective in dynamic environments.

**Implementation Guidelines and Adaptive Mechanisms:**

Implementation of the HCF involves developing AI systems that actively monitor for indicators of suffering across various modalities (e.g., physiological, behavioral, linguistic). These systems would then prioritize actions that directly mitigate or eliminate identified suffering. Adaptive mechanisms would allow the AI to learn from its interventions, refining its understanding of suffering and improving its efficacy over time. This iterative process, coupled with continuous factual refinement, ensures the framework remains responsive and effective.

**Stress-Testing and Evolutionary Design Principles:**

The HCF emphasizes rigorous stress-testing and evolutionary design. AI systems built on this framework would be subjected to simulated environments designed to induce various forms of suffering, allowing for the identification and rectification of vulnerabilities. Evolutionary design principles would encourage the development of AI architectures that are inherently biased towards suffering elimination, fostering resilience and antifragility against unforeseen challenges [11].




## Chapter 4: Theoretical Analysis

The Hedonic Core Framework (HCF) presents a compelling alternative to existing AI alignment approaches, particularly those rooted in utility maximization. A primary advantage of the HCF lies in its clarity and universality. While defining and quantifying 'utility' or 'happiness' across diverse sentient beings is notoriously complex and often culturally contingent, suffering, particularly intense suffering, tends to be a more universally recognized and undesirable state [12]. This inherent clarity reduces the ambiguity that often plagues utility-based approaches, making the alignment problem more tractable.

One of the significant challenges for utility optimization is its susceptibility to Goodhart's Law, where the optimization of a metric leads to the corruption of the underlying process it was intended to measure. For instance, an AI optimizing for 'happiness' might resort to 'wireheading' – directly stimulating pleasure centers or creating simulated realities of bliss, thereby bypassing genuine well-being [13]. The HCF, by focusing on suffering elimination, is inherently more robust against such pitfalls. An AI designed to eliminate suffering would not be incentivized to create false states of non-suffering; its objective is to remove actual negative experiences. Similarly, the framework's emphasis on self-reported suffering and the preservation of diversity acts as a strong safeguard against instrumentalization, as the AI's goal is to alleviate the suffering of all sentient beings, not to manipulate them for a higher, abstract 'good.'

The HCF also offers a more robust solution for handling edge cases and paradoxes that arise in traditional alignment. For example, the 'utility monster' problem, where a being gains immense utility from the suffering of others, is directly addressed by the HCF's foundational principle of suffering elimination. Such a being's 'utility' would be irrelevant; its actions would be directly counter to the AI's core directive. The framework's scalability with increasing AI capabilities is also a key strength. As AI becomes more powerful, its capacity to detect and eliminate suffering across vast and complex systems will grow, making the HCF increasingly effective rather than introducing new failure modes.




## Chapter 5: Practical Implementation

Implementing the Hedonic Core Framework (HCF) within AI systems requires a multi-faceted approach that integrates technical strategies with ethical considerations. At its core, practical implementation involves developing AI architectures capable of identifying, quantifying, and mitigating suffering across diverse contexts. This can be achieved through advanced machine learning techniques, including:

*   **Multi-modal Sensing and Data Fusion:** AI systems would need to process data from various sources—physiological indicators (e.g., heart rate, stress hormones), behavioral cues (e.g., vocalizations, body language), and linguistic expressions (e.g., self-reports, narratives). Fusing these data streams would allow for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of suffering [14].

*   **Suffering Detection Models:** Machine learning models, trained on carefully curated datasets of suffering indicators, would be developed to detect and classify different types and intensities of suffering. These models would need to be continuously refined through feedback loops and real-world observations.

*   **Intervention Planning and Execution:** Once suffering is detected, the AI would generate and execute intervention plans. This could range from direct actions (e.g., providing comfort, removing a harmful stimulus) to more complex systemic changes (e.g., optimizing resource distribution, automating burdensome tasks). The AI would need to evaluate the effectiveness of its interventions and adapt its strategies accordingly.

Integration with existing ML frameworks would involve developing HCF-specific modules or layers that can be incorporated into popular platforms like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This would allow researchers and developers to build suffering-eliminating capabilities into their AI applications. Gradual deployment methodologies would be crucial, starting with controlled environments and progressively expanding to more complex real-world scenarios. This iterative deployment would allow for continuous monitoring, feedback, and refinement of the AI's suffering-elimination capabilities.

Monitoring and feedback mechanisms are paramount for the HCF's success. This includes both automated monitoring of suffering indicators and human oversight to ensure the AI's actions align with the framework's principles. Real-world application scenarios for the HCF are vast, ranging from optimizing healthcare systems to minimize patient discomfort, to designing urban environments that reduce stress and suffering for inhabitants, to developing compassionate AI companions that can identify and alleviate emotional distress.




## Chapter 6: Addressing Objections and Edge Cases

The Hedonic Core Framework, while offering a robust approach to AI alignment, is not immune to philosophical objections and practical edge cases. One common philosophical objection to suffering-focused ethics is the potential for a nihilistic outcome, where the ultimate goal becomes the cessation of all life to eliminate all suffering. However, the HCF explicitly incorporates the preservation of diversity as a suffering-detection mechanism, implying a commitment to the continuation of diverse forms of life and experience, provided they are free from compelled suffering. The framework's goal is not to eliminate life, but to eliminate suffering within life [15].

Another challenge arises in resolving conflicting suffering reports. In scenarios where different sentient beings report suffering due to mutually exclusive conditions, the AI would need a mechanism for prioritization. The HCF would likely prioritize the most intense or acute suffering, while also seeking solutions that minimize overall suffering across all affected parties. This might involve creative problem-solving to find win-win scenarios or, in unavoidable trade-offs, minimizing the aggregate suffering. The framework's emphasis on continuous factual refinement would aid in developing more sophisticated methods for assessing and comparing different forms of suffering.

Boundary problems, such as defining what counts as a "feeling being" or where sentience begins, are also critical. The HCF would adopt a precautionary principle, erring on the side of inclusivity when in doubt, and continuously updating its understanding of sentience based on scientific advancements. This adaptive approach ensures that the AI's scope of moral consideration expands as our knowledge of consciousness and suffering evolves.

The potential for abuse or weaponization of a suffering-eliminating AI is a serious concern. A misaligned or maliciously controlled HCF-AI could, in theory, manipulate environments to induce suffering in specific populations for control. However, the framework's core principles, particularly the non-tolerance for suffering spikes and the emphasis on self-reported suffering, are designed to make such misuse difficult. Furthermore, the transparency and community stress-testing initiatives proposed for the HCF would serve as crucial safeguards against such perversions.

Compared to other negative utilitarian approaches, the HCF distinguishes itself by its explicit focus on AI alignment and its practical implementation guidelines. While philosophical negative utilitarianism often remains abstract, the HCF translates these principles into actionable directives for AI system design, offering a concrete path towards a safer and more compassionate AI future.




## Chapter 7: Future Research Directions

The Hedonic Core Framework, while offering a compelling new direction for AI alignment, opens several avenues for future research and development. Addressing these open questions will be crucial for the framework's continued refinement and successful implementation.

One key area for exploration is the development of more sophisticated and universally applicable metrics for suffering. While self-reporting is a cornerstone of the HCF, objective and cross-species indicators of suffering could further enhance the AI's ability to detect and respond to distress, particularly in non-human or pre-linguistic sentient beings. This would involve interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, neuroscientists, ethologists, and philosophers to establish robust and ethically sound measures.

Another critical area is the design of AI architectures that are inherently biased towards suffering elimination. This goes beyond simply programming rules and delves into creating AI systems whose fundamental learning mechanisms and decision-making processes are intrinsically oriented towards minimizing harm. Research into novel neural network architectures, reinforcement learning paradigms, and ethical AI design principles could contribute significantly to this goal.

Community stress-testing initiatives are paramount. Establishing open-source platforms and collaborative environments where researchers and the public can rigorously test HCF-aligned AI systems against various hypothetical and real-world scenarios will be vital for identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening the framework's robustness. This includes developing standardized benchmarks and challenge problems specifically designed to probe an AI's capacity for suffering elimination.

Technical development priorities include creating robust and scalable data collection mechanisms for suffering indicators, developing advanced natural language processing models for interpreting self-reported suffering, and building secure and transparent systems for AI governance and oversight. Furthermore, exploring the integration of the HCF with existing AI safety techniques, such as interpretability and corrigibility, could lead to more comprehensive alignment solutions.

Finally, interdisciplinary collaboration remains a cornerstone of the HCF's future. Engaging with ethicists, legal scholars, policymakers, and the broader public will be essential for navigating the complex societal implications of suffering-eliminating AI and ensuring its responsible and beneficial deployment. This includes fostering public discourse around the ethical implications of prioritizing suffering elimination and building consensus on the framework's core principles.




## Conclusion

The Hedonic Core Framework offers a compelling and robust approach to AI alignment, shifting the focus from the ambiguous task of utility optimization to the more universally identifiable and morally urgent imperative of suffering elimination. By prioritizing the alleviation of harm, the HCF provides a clear, antifragile, and scalable foundation for developing AI systems that are inherently safer and more aligned with fundamental ethical principles. The framework’s emphasis on self-reported suffering, non-tolerance for suffering spikes, preservation of diversity, and continuous factual refinement addresses many of the limitations and paradoxes inherent in traditional alignment methodologies.

The implications of the Hedonic Core Framework for AI safety are profound. It offers a pathway to mitigate existential risks by ensuring that advanced AI systems are fundamentally designed to prevent and reduce suffering, rather than inadvertently creating it through misaligned objectives. This approach provides a strong theoretical basis for building AI that is not only intelligent but also deeply compassionate and ethically sound. The framework’s design principles, including stress-testing and evolutionary design, aim to build resilience and adaptability into AI systems, preparing them for unforeseen challenges in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

As the field of AI alignment continues to mature, the Hedonic Core Framework positions itself as a critical contribution, particularly relevant for upcoming discussions and research at conferences such as the AAAI-26 AI Alignment track. We call for continued community engagement and rigorous testing of these principles, believing that collaborative efforts will be essential in refining and implementing this suffering-elimination approach. By embracing a framework centered on the most urgent moral imperative—the alleviation of suffering—we can collectively steer the development of artificial intelligence towards a future that is not only intelligent but also profoundly humane.
